# CMOST: A Python Toolkit for LAMOST Astronomical Data
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/cmost)
[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cmost?color=blue)](https://pypi.org/project/cmost/)

CMOST is a Python toolkit specifically designed for processing FITS files from LAMOST astronomical telescope observations. At its core, it's a secondary encapsulation of `astropy`, offering efficient and user-friendly data parsing and basic analysis capabilities.

### Key Features
- 🚀 Simple API interface `read_fits`, making FITS file handling as effortless as using `pandas` to read Excel files.
- 🔍 line index calculation algorithms.
- 📊 Basic spectral preprocessing methods.
- 🌐 FTP API for downloading official LAMOST FITS files with asynchronous support.
